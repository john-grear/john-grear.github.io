    I am always looking to broaden my horizons and strive to be a better person and software
    developer. I really want to travel the world, so any opportunities that would allow that would
    be a dream! I enjoy playing video games, cooking new foods, and solving puzzles.

    My favorite video games are Minecraft, Hollow Knight, Neva, Pokemon, and NES games like Mega Man
    and Kirby's Adventure.

    I love cooking and trying foods from all over the world. Some of my favorite foods to cook are
    fettucine alfredo and breads of all kind (which I guess is also technically baking haha). I love
    solving puzzles and challenging myself.

    I started collecting Rubik's Cubes back in junior high school and sat in my room for days
    figuring out how to solve my first 3x3. Now I have over 20 and I still try to get to them all
    occasionally. I also love collecting playing cards to remember places that I've been to.

    I’ve got a pretty wild sock collection—easily over 100 pairs at this point. It all started back
    in junior high when I got tired of plain white socks and decided to switch things up. Now I’ve
    got socks with everything from food prints to movie and video game characters. Honestly, it
    makes getting dressed a little more fun each morning. If you’re thinking of upgrading your sock
    game, I’d recommend checking out Wal-Mart—they’ve got sets of six crew socks for around $10,
    which is where I usually stock up.
