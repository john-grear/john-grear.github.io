      My journey in higher education began at <strong>Wright State University (WSU)</strong>, where
      I spent my first two years building a strong academic and professional foundation. As a
      <strong>Computer Science Teaching Assistant</strong>, I worked closely with students to guide
      them through challenging concepts, solidifying my own knowledge while developing
      communication, mentorship, and leadership skills.

    <p class="mt-4">
      This experience not only deepened my technical expertise but also taught me the value of
      collaboration and patience â€” qualities that continue to influence my approach to
      problem-solving in the tech world.

      In 2021, as in-person learning resumed following the COVID-19 pandemic, I made the decision to
      transfer to <strong>Bowling Green State University</strong> to complete my degree.

      At <strong>Bowling Green State University (BGSU)</strong>, I immersed myself in an advanced
      curriculum covering programming languages, algorithms, software engineering, and other core
      areas of computer science. I actively engaged in discussions with professors and peers,
      sharpening my problem-solving abilities and gaining real-world insights into software
      development practices.

    <p class="mt-4">
      My time at BGSU not only refined my technical skill set but also equipped me with the
      adaptability and creativity needed to thrive in a fast-changing tech industry.
